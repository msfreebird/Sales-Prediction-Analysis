âœ¨SALES PREDICTION ANALYSIS USING MACHINE LEARNINGâœ¨
This project aims to predict sales using machine learning techniques implemented in Python with Jupyter Notebook. By analyzing historical sales data, we build a predictive model that can forecast future sales based on various factors such as advertising expenditure, seasonality, economic indicators, etc.

ðŸ’¡PROJECT OVERVIEW
The project includes the following components:

âœ…Data Collection: Historical sales data is collected from various sources such as CSV files, databases, or APIs.

âœ…Data Preprocessing: The collected data is cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis.
This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

âœ…Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploring the dataset to gain insights into the relationships between features and the target variable (sales).
Visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices are used to understand the data better.

âœ…Model Building: Building machine learning models to predict sales.
Various regression techniques such as Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression are implemented and evaluated.

âœ…Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the trained models using appropriate metrics 
such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

âœ…Deployment: Deploying the final model to make predictions on new data.
This can involve saving the trained model and creating an interface for users to input data and get predictions.
